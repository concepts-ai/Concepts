"""Data structures for language semantics and tools for parsing.
Most of this package are designed for neuro-symbolic representations of
natrual language semantics and grammar-based language learning.

See the following papers for more details:

- The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner: Interpreting Scenes, Words, and Sentences From Natural Supervision (http://nscl.csail.mit.edu/)
- Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon Learning (https://g2l2.csail.mit.edu/)

Here's a quick summary of the sub-modules:

- :mod:`concepts.language.ccg` contains tools for parsing sentences with (purely symbolic) Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCGs).
